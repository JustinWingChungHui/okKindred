Concept:
To model our family tree

Ideas:
- Adding a member and an email will automatically assign a login (email and auto-generated password to the site)
- This login will be emailed out to the person that has been added
- Django website on PythonAnywhere.com, allows scaling
- Biographies need to be available in different languages (probably need help of Hilson, Vicky, Ola and Kati)
- Notification emails of anyone new that is added (if this explodes may need to restrict this)

Requirements:
- Multilingual (English, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Polish, Finish... from what we know already)


Data Model:
- Person:
	- email (optional, if supplied, automatically create a Django user)
	- user_id (Django user id if email exists)
	- name (Free text because inversion of last and first names in different cultures)
	- birth_year (optional)
	- location ( GPS coord, allow to enter on a map optional)
	- picture (optional)
	- gender (M/F/Neutral) Helps to draw a chart if all the females are on one side.  Also help to identify bloodlines.
	- telephone_number (optional)
	- website (optional could be a Facebook link)
	- hierarchy_score (Calculated field if Justin is 100 then Shirley is 99)
	

- Biographies (Separate object to allow for different languages)
	- person_id (Foreign Key to Person)
	- language_code (English/Chinese Traditional/Chinese Simplified/Polish/Finnish)
	- biography_text
	
- Relation:
	- from_person_id (Foreign Key to Person)
	- to_person_id (Foreign Key to Person)
	-relation_type:
		- Partnered (can include divorcees, from and to are equivalent so assigned same hierarchy_score)
		- Raised (from_person_id is parent/guardian and to_person_id is child/dependent)
		- Raised by (resolves to the above inverted)

- Telemetry (who's looked at what just for administrators ie you and me to see)
	- person_id
	- utc_datetime
	- ip_address
	- action_text
		- viewed biog of
		- viewed map of
		- etc

		
Views
	- Home page:
		- Description of site and who we are
		- Login Screen
	
	- Hierarchy view starts centred on logged in user
		- Shows relation diagram
		- Shows only 2 levels deep
		- Each person shows name and picture
		- Lines show relation type
		- Lowest hierarchy score at the top
		- Clicking on a person reloads view centred on that person
		- Centred person shows link to show biography
		- Centred person show link to add a relation to a new person
		
	- Map View. 
		- Same as hierarchy view but on map
		
	- Show all Map view (this could be awesome)
	
	- Edit/Create user
		- To start, allow anyone to edit anyone else's profile and links, maybe look to only allow edit 2 levels away in future.  
		(we have to assume that Grandparents profiles will be maintained by Grandchildren)
		
	- Change my Password
